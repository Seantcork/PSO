The pso.cpp file contains our PSO algorithm. To run the file:

1. Type `make` to create the executable.
2. The PSO is run through the command `./pso topology swarmSize numIterations evaluationFunction numDimensions`
    1. For example `./pso gl 16 10000 rok 30`
3. The folder also contains a script and parse file that was used to run the experiments.
